# road_events (Formerly Common Core Data Dictionary)
**Required**

This table contains information about road events.  The information describes where, when, and what activity is taking place along a road segment. This specification currently accommodates work zones; This design accommodates multiple road event types.

This table is related to the [road_event_feed_info](/data-tables/road_event_feed_info.md) table by the foreign key feed_info_id.  For every record in the road_event_feed_info table there must exist one or more road_event records.

This table is related to the [lanes](/data-tables/lanes.md) table;  For each record in the  road_events table there may exists a one or more records in the lanes table.  The road_event_id field acts  as the foreign key in the lanes table.

This table is related to the [activities](/data-tables/activities.md) table;  For each record in the  road_events table there may exists a one or more records in the activites table.  The road_event_id field acts  as the foreign key in the activities table.
